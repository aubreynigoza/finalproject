# Kubectl
Kubectl is retrieved from AWS using a python script located in `Scripts/kube-update.py`

This script creates the kubectl configuration file in `/home/.kube/config`.
Ensure all requirements are downloaded and installed prior to running the script. `Terraform apply` should be successfully ran before the script.
